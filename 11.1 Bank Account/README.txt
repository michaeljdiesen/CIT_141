You are to design and implement bank account usage. It is up to you to include more or less bank account activities. A typical bank account will include: account number, name (first, last), checking balance/interest rate/last updated date, savings balance/interest rate/last updated date. The activities may include (not limited to): open an account; check balance; deposit to checking or saving; cash from checking or saving; transfer from checking/saving to saving/checking.

You will specify the program input and check the output. It is assumed that user will also enter the date of an activity (e.g., today's date).

Note: You code should use class(es) for the design and coding. You will decide how to calculate the interest earned (e.g., by days or months or years); If you would like to make the project simpler, you may skip the interest calculation (i.e., assuming interest rate = 0).
