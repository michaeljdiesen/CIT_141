Define first a class circleType: member variables: radius; member functions: setRadius, print, circumference, area, and constructor Define a class cylinderType derived from circleType: member variables: height; member functions: setHeight, print, surface, volume, and construtor Write a program that tests both the circleType and cylinderType. Input: The program first read in the radius of a circleType object, then read in the radius and height of a cylinderType object. e.g., 5 4 6 Output: the program shall test each member function of the circleType and cylinderType respectively. Define: const double PI = 3.14159
