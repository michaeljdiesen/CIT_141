Write a program to convert the time from 24-hour (hours, minutes, and seconds) notation to 12-hour notation and vice versa. Your program must be menu driven, giving the user the choice of converting the time between the two notations. Furthermore, your program must contain at least the following functions: a function to convert the time from 24-hour notation to 12-hour notation, a function to convert the time from 12-hour notation to 24-hour notation, a function to display the choices, function(s) to get the input, and the function(s) to display the results. (For 12-hour time notation, you program must display AM or PM.) Time format example: 04:30:25 PM.

Convert Choices: 1: to convert from 12-hour notation to 24-hour notation; 2: to convert from 24-hour notation to 12-hour notation; 99: to exit. The program should allow users to convert time repeatedly until the choice value is 99.
