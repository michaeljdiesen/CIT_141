Write a program that prints the day number of the year, given the date information of month, day, and year. For example, if the date is 12 25 2006, the day number is 359. The program should check for a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100. It is also a leap year if it is divisible by 400. For example, 1992 and 2000 are leap years; but 1800 is not a leap year.
